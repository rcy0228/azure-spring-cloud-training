# Exercise 4 - Configure a Spring Apps Config server

A key feature of cloud-native applications is *externalized configuration* - the ability to store, manage, and version configuration separately from the application code. In this section, we'll configure a [Spring Apps Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config) to enable this functionality. In the next section, you'll see how Spring Apps Config can inject configuration from a Git repository into your application.

## Task 1 : Configure Azure Spring Apps to access the Git repository

1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). From the resource group **spring-apps-workshop-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** select the Azure Spring Apps Instance named **azure-spring-apps-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

2. Go to the **Overview** page of Azure Spring Apps server and select `Config server` in the menu under `Settings`

   ![Config server](../media/configserver.png)

3. On the **Config Server** page, follow the below mentioned instructions:

      - Configure the repository by providing the public repository URI **https://github.com/Azure-Samples/spring-cloud-sample-public-config.git** inside URI field of **Default repository**

     >ðŸ’¡ Make sure you include the `.git` ending in the URL.
 
     - Click on "Validate" and wait for the operation to succeed

4. Click on "Apply" and wait for the operation to succeed.

     ![apply](../media/applynew.png)

## Review

We have now created a private configuration repository. We have enabled Azure Spring Apps to create a configuration server with the configuration files from this repository.

In the next section, we will create an application that consumes this configuration, specifically the custom message we defined in `application.yml`.
